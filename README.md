1. Backend: Python Flask API

    Flask will handle API requests and process the images from the mobile webcam for skin analysis.

        Create a Flask project that will expose REST API endpoints to upload images and perform analysis.

    Install necessary libraries:
        Use libraries like OpenCV, Pillow, and numpy for image processing.
        You can also integrate a machine learning model for skin analysis, possibly using TensorFlow or PyTorch.

        Install Next.js and set up a basic frontend.
        Use the getUserMedia API in the browser to access the webcam.
    Webcam Capture Code:
